A short, simple and explandable package I created in a few days experimenting with the Cursor ide.

I can say that around 25% of the code is generated. The rest is handwritten as making everything work and look coherent was something I had to do myself. It already contains support for:

1. Transform position
2. Transform rotation
3. Transform scale

I also added a GameObjectRecorder and GameObjectReplaySource component for composition purposes. Adding these to a game object allows you to record multiple Recorder and ReplaySource implementations at once. 

Use as you'd like.
